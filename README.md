# TING

TING is a project developed as part of the "Trybe" course to simulate functions that would work in a search system like Google.

## Features

The project includes the following features:

- **Search for keywords within a database** (in this case, it works with a JSON file since there is no integration with a database).
- **Priority search queue**, with both normal and priority queues.
- **Request queuing system** (in FIFO format).

## Technologies Used

The project was developed using the following technologies:

- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**
- **Python**
- **PIB**
- **Pytest**

## Installation

To install and run the project locally, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git@github.com:PedroEmmanuelBuerger/project-TING.git`.
2. Ensure you have the PIB library for Python installed, then run the command: `pip install`.
3. To run the tests, execute: `python3 run tests`.

## Key Learnings

The main learning was how to identify the complexity of code, such as how much memory it uses and how long it takes to execute. It was also possible to learn various ways to handle code in different situations to reduce its complexity, working with arrays in stack and queue formats, all using Python.

## Conclusion

The application was an excellent starting point for applying computer science concepts and also a great way to refine my skills with the Python language, using its tools and various libraries.
